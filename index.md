# About
TTQM2025 continues the long-running series of bilateral workshops between Japanese and Swiss physicists in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics. It brings together the leading members of both communities, and also aims at nurturing scientific exchanges, collaborations, and friendships among young physicists working in the two countries.

# Dates 
September 19 - 22, 2025

# Venue
[Saitama University](https://en.saitama-u.ac.jp) ([Access/Map](https://en.saitama-u.ac.jp/about/mapsaccess/))

You can reach Saitama University by taking a local train to nearby stations such as Kitara-Urawa or Minami-Yono, followed by a local bus to the university. Please note that buses can be crowded during rush hours. The first lecture in Saitama University begins at 9:00 AM on weekdays.
During rush hours, we recommend boarding the bus at either Kitara-Urawa Station, Minami-Yono Station, Shiki Station, or Kita-Asaka Station, as these are the first stops where you can get a seat. Note that from Minami-Yono Station, there are two bus routes to the university - we specifically recommend taking the route where Minami-Yono is the first stop.

We will arrange a bus service from Omiya to the venue (see below).
