# Access from train stations to the compus
You can reach Saitama University by taking a local train to nearby stations such as

* Kita-Urawa Station
* Minami-Yono Station
* Shiki Station

followed by a local bus to the university.

**Important Note on Access from Omiya Station**

Google/Apple map may recommend you to take Saikyo Line (SK) to Minami-Yono Station, then take a local bus.
But, we do NOT recommend this route because the buses are crowded.

Instead, you can take Keihin-Tohoku Line (JK) to Kita-Urawa Station,
then take a local bus at [the bus stop](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=35.871569069264034,139.64573722331843) located in front of a burger restaurant (Mos Burger).
