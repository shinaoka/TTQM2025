# Access from train stations to the compus
You can reach Saitama University by taking a local train to nearby stations such as

* Kita-Urawa Station
* Minami-Yono Station
* Shiki Station

followed by a local bus to the university.

**Important Note on Access from Omiya Station**

Google/Apple map may recommend you to take Saikyo Line (SK) to Minami-Yono Station, then take a local bus.
But, we do NOT recommend this route because the buses are crowded.

Instead, you can take Keihin-Tohoku Line (JK) to Kita-Urawa Station,
then take a local bus at [the bus stop](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=35.871569069264034,139.64573722331843) located in front of a burger restaurant (Mos Burger).
All buses departing from this bus stop go to Saitama University (埼玉大学).
If there is a queue, please wait for the next bus. Buses are frequent.

# Excursion
If the weather is fine, we will organize a short excursion from Saitama Shintoshin Station to [Hikawa-jinja Shrine](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1525/) in Omiya.
The approach to the shrine is about 3 km long.
There are many parks around the shrine where you can enjoy nature.
A bus from the campus to Saitama Shintoshin Station will depart at 13:00 on 21st October.

If you want to visit other places, please use public transportation. There are many options, including [Kawagoe](https://koedo.or.jp/feel-edo-culture/en/), which is 1 hour away from Saitama Shintoshin Station by local train and bus.
